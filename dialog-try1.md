## START

-- After defeating Spamton Neo. Queen's basement --

Spamton: It seems after all I couldn't be anything more than a simple puppet.

Spamton: But you three... You're strong.

Spamton: With a power like that...

Spamton: Maybe you three can break your own strings.

Spamton: Let me become your strength.

(Since CC only has 16 colors and I don't want waste any for transparency, just use dithering to make Spamton gradually disappear and be replaced with a star as an item that slowly falls to the ground)

(Instead of where in the original game Spamton gets added in Kris' inventory, Kris will just walk away with Susie and Ralsei following)

Spamton: ...

Spamton: They left me.

Spamton: They didn't even want me.

Spamton: But maybe...

(The star item gets replaced with spamton in a single frame)

Spamton: MAYBE I DON'T NEED THEM! MAYBE I DON'T NEED [[FREEDOM]]!

Spamton: OR MAYBE... MY APPROACH WAS TOO NARROW.

Spamton: I DON'T NEED TO BE [[BIGGER]]. I NEED TO BE [[Faster Than The Speed Of Sound]]!

Spamton: BUT I'LL NEED SOME [[Customer Support]].

(Spamton glides down to the exit of the room)

(Fade to black with setting palette colors)

## SHAWN

(Fade back in to Shawn in his shop in the Castle Town.)

(Spamton glides into the shop.)

Spamton: SEAM! OLD FRIEND, OLD PAL, OLD [[End User License Agreement]]!

Spamton: I'VE COME TO MAKE A [[Deal of a Lifetime]]!

Seam: ...Spamton. I thought you'd be... well, recycled by now.

Seam: What is it you're selling this time? Broken dreams? Empty promises?

Spamton: BETTER! I'M IN THE MARKET FOR [[Luxury]]! FOR [[Horsepower]]!

Spamton: I NEED A VEHICLE, SEAM! A REAL [[BIG SHOT]] AUTOMOBILE! ONE THAT CAN OUTRUN THE [[Hands of Fate]] THEMSELVES!

Seam: A vehicle? Heh. And what would you pay for it with? You don't seem to have a... leg... to stand on.

(Spamton freezes for a moment, glitching.)

Spamton: I'LL GET THE [[Kromer]]! I ALWAYS GET THE [[Kromer]]! I JUST NEED THE PARTS! THE [[Scrap Metal]]! THE GUTS OF THE MACHINE! YOU'VE BEEN AROUND, OLD CAT. YOU KNOW WHERE THE WORLD HIDES ITS TRASH.

(Seam looks away, a strange mix of pity and amusement in his one button eye. He's quiet for a moment.)

Seam: Well, there is a place... The Great Garbage Grave, south of the city. A mountain of forgotten things. The higher you climb, the better the... quality... of the refuse. Be warned. Many things have been thrown away there. Not all of them are happy about it.

Spamton: PERFECT! IT'S A [[Fixer Upper]] OPPORTUNITY!

Seam: You'll need a way to get around in that mess. Here.

(Seam pulls a small, glowing blue heart from under his counter.)

Seam: Found this thing rolling around in the back. It's not for sale. Too... persistent. It has a habit of wanting to go up. Perhaps you two can be miserable together.

Spamton: A [[Free Gift With Purchase]]!? SEAM, YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN! WITH THIS [[Heart-Shaped Object]], I'LL REACH THE TOP! I'LL BUILD MY RIDE! I'LL BECOME SO [[Fast & Furious]] EVEN MY OWN [[Strings]] WON'T CATCH ME!

## END

(Cyber World. Spamton stands in front of a ready to go purple truck. Soul glides in from behind.)

Spamton: AH! MY [[Trusted Business Partner]]! JUST IN TIME FOR THE [[Grand Opening]]!

Spamton: LOOK AT THIS [[Beauty On Wheels]]! THOSE FRAMES FROM THE [[Trash Zone]], THE [[Premium Quality]] WHEELS...

Spamton: AND THE [[Heart]] OF THE OPERATION! THAT [[Image_Friend]]'S FACE WHEN WE [[Borrowed]] THEIR ENGINE! HEHEHE!

(Soul bobs up and down excitedly)

Spamton: WHAT'S THAT? YOU WANT TO [[Carpool]] WITH THE BIGGEST [[Shot]] IN TOWN?

(Soul nods vigorously)

Spamton: THEN HOP IN, [[Little Buddy]]! WE'VE GOT A [[One Way Trip]] TO [[Freedom]]!

(Soul jumps into the back of the truck. Spamton climbs into the driver's seat.)

Spamton: NO MORE [[Strings]] HOLDING US DOWN! NO MORE [[Admin Privileges]] CONTROLLING OUR LIVES!

(The truck's engine roars to life, multicolored smoke puffing from the exhaust)

Spamton: HERE WE GO! [[3]]... [[2]]... [[1]]...

(The truck peels out, leaving digital tire marks)

Spamton: NEXT STOP: [[ANYWHERE BUT HERE]]!!!

(The truck speeds off into the digital sunset, leaving a trail of glitching pixels)

-- THE END --
